 This directory (cnceleb) contains example scripts for CN-Celeb 
 speaker verification.  The CN-Celeb corpus is required, and can be
 downloaded from OpenSLR http://www.openslr.org/82/.

 The subdirectories "v1" and so on are different speaker recognition
 recipes.  The recipe in v1 demonstrates a standard approach using a
 full-covariance GMM-UBM, iVectors, and a PLDA backend.  The example
 in v2 demonstrates DNN speaker embeddings with a PLDA backend.
